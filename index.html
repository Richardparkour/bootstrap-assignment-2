      <ul> 
          <li> <p>The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva lingas in India. It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja â€“ Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century.</p></li>
          <li>Another interesting fact about its architecture is that the vimana (tower above the sanctum sanctorum) of the temple does not cast a shadow at noon! The temple is fully made of granite and has Chola frescoes on its walls, portraying various facets of Lord Shiva.</li>    
          <li>Another mysterious fact associated with this temple is there are several underground passages which connected the different temples of Chola period. In addition to that there are secret passages within the temple which connected all the secret places of the kings. Many of them have been sealed</li>
